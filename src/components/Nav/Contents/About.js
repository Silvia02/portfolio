            My name is Silvia, I'm a Junior frontend developer. <br /> I like to
            code and to be in constant learning. <br />
            I like the simple things in life. <br /> I am curious and like to
            learn new things. Love quiet places and breathe the fresh air from
            nature. <br />I have big interest and ambition to learn about Web
            Development and the digital world. I want to contribute to and be
            part of that development. <br />- Stockholm, Sweden!
